# Content Extraction using Open Source and Enterprise Service

## Project Description

In this project, we focus on developing a prototype AI application that extracts, processes, and organizes data from unstructured sources such as PDFs and web pages. The goal is to evaluate the feasibility of using open-source tools versus enterprise solutions for data extraction and transformation.

Technologies Involved:
1. PDF Extraction: 
  * Open Source: pymupdf, pdfplumber, Fitz
  * Enterprise: Adobe API Extract
2. Website Scraping:
  * Open Source: BeuatifulSoup, requests
  * Enterprise: Apify
